# Predicting Pneumonia Using Chest X-Rays

Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that affects millions of people a year as one of the most common causes for admission to a hospital.  To diagnose a patient with pneumonia, chest x-rays are typically taken to a highly trained specialist in order to diagnose the extent and location of the infection.  If the process for such a common infection can be streamlined and made more efficient through automation and machine learning, patients would be able to receive treatment faster and doctors would be able to diagnose more patients.

We will be using data sourced from:

The images are organized into training, validation, and testing sets.

We train a neural network on the image data in order to predict whether or not pneumonia is present in a chest x-ray image.  We will also take a closer look at what our model is doing when it looks at our images in order to interpret the results.
